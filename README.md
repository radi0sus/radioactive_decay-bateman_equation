# Calculation of radioactive decay chains and branched decays
Calculation of radioactive decay chains (mother -> daughter -> granddaughter .....): 1 -> 2 -> 3 -> 4 -> .....

and calculation of branched decays (mother -> daughter1 + daughter2 + .....): 1 -> 2 + 3 + .....

using the Bateman equation.

Several examples.
