Values to change. 
- l means lamda which is the decay constant 
- lambda = log(2)/t(1/2) (log means the natural logarithm)
- t(1/2) is half-life (units (e.g. seconds, days, years) should be equal for all t(1/2))
- N0 is the initial amount of active substance. Since the script calculates relative values, 
  changes of N0 have no effect on the result.
